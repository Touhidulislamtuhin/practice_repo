    <h2><strong>Sajek valley Travel Experience</strong> </h2>
        <p>
            Dhaka To Jaliapara To Dighinala & Baghaichhari
Our journey started from Dhaka at 11:30 pm by a reserved bus Saint Martin Paribahan (17 Feb 2022). The story of  Sajek that I have only heard in public so far, now it is the turn of that dream to come true. The bus dropped us off at Jaliapara (Guimara, Haphchhari) very early in the morning. We didn’t have breakfast down there. Then we set off in a pre-arranged Chander Gari for Dighinala which is nearly 52km from Jaliapara. Taking breakfast we set for to get lost in the realm of clouds which means for Sajek Valley.<br>
<br>
We reached Dighinala in the Chander Gari and had breakfast. Then we left for Baghaichhari. After taking pictures for a while, we left for Baghaichhari again. From Baghaichhari, the Army soldiers took all the Chander Gari vehicles together. There are many CNG Auto Rickshaws, Private Car, and related vehicles too. The Army took the vehicles twice in a day, around 10 to 11 in the morning and around 2 to 3 in the afternoon. We stood in Baghaichhari for about an hour. In the gap, we see the ethnic market here. It was interesting.
<br>
Day 1: Baghaichhari To Sajek Valley
The Sajek Valley, a distance of 34 km from Dighinala, started. We were very tired, but as soon as the journey of the moon car (Chander Gari) started its journey, the fatigue disappeared. Believe that the beauty of the way to and from Sajek will make you half your money. And the driver of the moon car driving brother! <a href="https://beautifulbangladesh.gov.bd/cat/hill-tracts-waterfalls/11" target="_blank"><button>Read more</button></a>
